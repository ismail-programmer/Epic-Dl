More Details

- Must be able to deposit credits.

- Must be able to deposit credits automatically each month.

- Products would just be anycast ddos protection for which they will automatically be given a price depending on the 
bandwidth tier they reach. (It will need to be able to be adjusted by admins for each client)  

- Users who register during beta must be able to receive a permanent discount which can be set by admin. 
We would like to be able to do different rounds of promotions so it should be adjustable and have different groups for users 
who sign up for different promotions.

-Under services for ddos protection it should display tiered pricing for example 
1TB x$ 10TB y$ 100TB z$ and show what the user has currently used. 
We will also need to have time for how recently bandwidth usage was updated.
